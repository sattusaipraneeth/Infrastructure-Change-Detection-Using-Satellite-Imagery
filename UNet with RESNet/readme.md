# U-Net with ResNet for Infrastructure Change Detection

This repository provides a **U-Net model with a ResNet backbone** for infrastructure change detection using the **Levir-CD dataset**. The model combines U-Net's powerful segmentation capabilities with ResNet's deep feature extraction, ensuring **high accuracy** and **robust performance** in identifying changes between two satellite images. It is ideal for applications such as **urban development monitoring, disaster assessment, and land-use analysis**.

Optimized for efficient computation, this implementation is designed to work even on devices with limited resources.
