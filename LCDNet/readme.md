# LCDNet - Infrastructure Change Detection

LCDNet is a deep learning model designed for infrastructure change detection using the Levir-CD dataset. It efficiently identifies changes between two images captured at different times, making it useful for urban planning, disaster assessment, and environmental monitoring. The model leverages advanced convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to provide accurate and reliable change detection results. Optimized for lightweight deployment, LCDNet ensures high performance even on devices with limited computational resources.
