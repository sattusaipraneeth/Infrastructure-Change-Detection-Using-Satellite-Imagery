# Siamese U-Net for Infrastructure Change Detection

This repository provides a **Siamese U-Net** model for infrastructure change detection using the **Levir-CD dataset**. Siamese U-Net leverages two parallel U-Net networks with shared weights to extract deep features from **bi-temporal satellite images**, enabling precise and reliable change detection. This architecture enhances feature comparison and improves accuracy for applications such as **urban development tracking, disaster response, and land-use analysis**.

Optimized for efficient performance, this model balances computational cost and detection accuracy.
