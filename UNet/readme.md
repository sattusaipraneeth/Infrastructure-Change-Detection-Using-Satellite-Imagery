# U-Net for Infrastructure Change Detection

This repository contains a U-Net-based deep learning model for infrastructure change detection using the **Levir-CD dataset**. The model is designed to identify and highlight changes between two satellite images taken at different times. U-Net's encoder-decoder architecture ensures accurate segmentation, making it suitable for urban monitoring, disaster assessment, and land-use analysis.  

Optimized for low-memory devices, this implementation provides efficient change detection without compromising performance.
